When i tried. 

*WebApp version works good*

*when running in android found:-*

1. Picking image from gallery works good
2. Picking image from camera in android has issues

2.a. *Did using module import 'package:camera/camera.dart';*
   Found build issue which is attached in the log above
   Compatibility issue:-
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67116189/flutter-camera-plugin-version-0-8-1-not-compatible-with-androidx 
   fixed by increasing minsdk and increasing compil and target sdk version to 31
   not suitable for picking image.
   Mainly for rendering image

2.b *Did using import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';*
   It has issues like some time the mainactivity in android crashes due to
   garbage collection
   https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/48016
   This bug is still open
   
   A possible solution :- *Handling MainActivity destruction on Android *
   https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker
   Did not implement as it gets complicated on rendering the image. After all the solution is only for after crash.
     
   Note:- but keeping on trying to set, sometimes working.(Partially Working)


When dealing with images all are reading using XFile and converting them to 
Uint8List(inbuilt)

Note:- *So processing images from Uint8List datatype is found easier. So when when dealing with images its best to convert them or read the image file as Uint8list.*
